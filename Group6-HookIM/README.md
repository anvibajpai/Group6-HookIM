## Deviations
- Decided not to have an "Already have an account? Login in" button since the back button allows users to navigate back to login screen
- For a cleaner look and allowing for longer names, first and last name text fields on Create account screen are wider and on separate lines
- Added alert messaages on each login and account creation screen for incorrect or incomplete inputs.
